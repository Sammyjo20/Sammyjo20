### 👋 Howdy. I'm Sam! 🤠

I build web apps for the financial industry and developer community. During the day I work at Plannr Technologies Ltd. We're building a revolutionary back-office system for the financial industry from the ground up.

### My Open Source Packages

#### 🤠 Saloon
Saloon is tool to help you build better integrations with third-party APIs. It provides you with an eloquent, standardised syntax that will scale with your team. With Saloon, you don't have to worry about the underlying HTTP Client like Guzzle and spend more time with the data that APIs give you.

#### 🔥 XML Wrangler
XML Wrangler is a simplistic, modern PHP library designed to make reading and writing XML easy. XML Wrangler has been built with developer experience in mind - you can read any type of XML file, even with complex namespaces and even large XML files. It will also throw exceptions if the XML is invalid!

#### 🌵 Cactus (Upcoming)
Cactus is a super simple tool that allows you to create data transfer objects (or DTOs) on your local machine directly from your tests or your terminal. It is a great companion to any developer working with Saloon or XML Wrangler or just building lots of API integrations.

This is coming soon, keep an eye out on my Twitter/X profile!

#### 🏇 Lasso 

Lasso is your asset "wrangler" (see what I did there). It's built for Laravel, and it automatically compiles your Webpack/Laravel Mix assets and uploads them to a Filesystem of your choice. It will then download those assets on all your web servers.

#### 👩‍🌾 Laravel Haystack (Retired)
Laravel Haystack is a package that allows you to have a job chain stored in the database. Since all of the jobs in the chain are in the database, memory usage is low and you can delay jobs for a long time or have long running jobs without risking using all your memory. Laravel Haystack supports every queue connection/worker out of the box. (Database, Redis/Horizon, SQS).
