### 👋 Howdy. I'm Sam! 🤠

I build web apps for the financial industry and developer community. During the day I work at Plannr Technologies Ltd. We're building a revolutionary back-office system for the financial industry from the ground up

### My Open Source Packages

#### 🤠 Saloon
Saloon is tool to help you build better integrations with third party APIs. It provides you with an eloquent, standardised syntax that will scale with your team. With Saloon, you don't have to worry about the underlying HTTP Client like Guzzle and spend more time with the data that APIs give you. 

You can learn more about Saloon by clicking [here](https://github.com/sammyjo20/saloon)

#### 👩‍🌾 Laravel Haystack
Laravel Haystack is a package that allows you to have a job chain stored in the database. Since all of the jobs in the chain are in the database, memory usage is low and you can delay jobs for a long time or have long running jobs without risking using all your memory. Laravel Haystack supports every queue connection/worker out of the box. (Database, Redis/Horizon, SQS).

#### 🏇 Lasso 

Lasso is your asset "wrangler" (see what I did there). It's built for Laravel, and it automatically compiles your Webpack/Laravel Mix assets and uploads them to a Filesystem of your choice. It will then download those assets on all your web servers.

You can learn more about Lasso on the official website: [getlasso.dev](https://getlasso.dev)
#### ☸️ Wagonwheel 

Wagonwheel is a simple Laravel package built for one sole purpose: To provide an online version of all your Laravel emails. It's fully customisable and really quick to implement.

You can learn more about Wagonwheel [here](https://github.com/sammyjo20/wagonwheel).

### 💖 Support my work

While I never expect anything, if you would like to support my work, you can donate to my Ko-Fi page by simply buying me a coffee or two. The coffee will help keep me fueled on my next late-night working on open source.
