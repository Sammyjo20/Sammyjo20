### Hello I'm Sam!

I build web apps for the financial industry and developer community. During the day I work at Team Codepotato, a web development agency who build "spudtacular" applications for the financial industry.

### Current Projects

#### Saloon
Saloon is tool to help you build better integrations with third party APIs. It provides you with an eloquent, standardised syntax that will scale with your team. With Saloon, you don't have to worry about the underlying HTTP Client like Guzzle and spend more time with the data that APIs give you. 

You can learn more about Saloon by clicking [here](https://github.com/sammyjo20/saloon)

#### Lasso 

Lasso is your asset "wrangler" (see what I did there). It's built for Laravel, and it automatically compiles your Webpack/Laravel Mix assets and uploads them to a Filesystem of your choice. It will then download those assets on all your web servers.

You can learn more about Lasso on the official website: [getlasso.dev](https://getlasso.dev)
#### Wagonwheel 

Wagonwheel is a simple Laravel package built for one sole purpose: To provide an online version of all your Laravel emails. It's fully customisable and really quick to implement.

You can learn more about Wagonwheel [here](https://github.com/sammyjo20/wagonwheel).

### About Me

‚ö° Fun fact: I setup an internet radio station when I was 13 years old, which sparked my interest in Web Development!
